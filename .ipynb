    "{\"abstract\": \"Although we are witnessing the accelerated development of computer science, and the opening of new fields of study, compiler construction is still a very important field that is taught at most world universities. Because of a large number of algorithms and complex theoretical constructions, these topics represent a difficult and complex domain for teachers to teach and for students to gain a better understanding. Educational software systems play an increasingly important role in the engineering sciences. The aim of these systems is to help students learn by turning abstract theoretical concepts into tangible objects that students can interact with. In this paper, we present the web-based simulation system ComVis (https://comvis.pr.ac.rs), which represents a set of tools for learning and teaching topics in the field of compiler. The original version of the ComVis system is written in Java and is available as a desktop application. For greater accessibility and better visual representation, we have developed a web-based simulation system. In addition to new functionalities, this system also includes a large number of topics from the field of compilers. This paper provides an overview of the tools that comprise the web-based ComVis system, with an emphasis on the interactivity that students achieve with the system in the learning process. The results of using the web-based ComVis system were verified by a quantitative evaluation of the system's effectiveness through a controlled experiment and qualitative evaluation of usability by student survey and heuristic tests by experts.\", \"authors\": [{\"family\": \"Stamenković\", \"given\": \"Srećko\", \"orcid\": \"0000000209334379\", \"sequence\": \"first\"}, {\"family\": \"Jovanović\", \"given\": \"Nenad\", \"orcid\": \"0000000288727516\", \"sequence\": \"additional\"}], \"content\": \"## I. INTRODUCTION\\n\\n\\nOMPILER construction provides the necessary foundation for a thorough understanding of programming language design. That is why the compiler course is undoubtedly one of the most important in computer science study programs. This course helps students to become engineers and scientists and not just programmers. For portability, compilers are divided into two parts, front-end and back-end . The front-end handles high-level programming languages and generates intermediate code. The back-end optimizes the intermediate code and is responsible for generating instructions or low-level code that depends on the architecture of the target machine. The front-end of the compiler is also called the analysis part, because it is responsible for lexical, syntax and semantic analysis. Compiler technology, particularly the analysis part, is necessary to process all language input, formal or natural, of any computer system. Lexical analysis of a programming language involves Srećko Stamenković is with the Toplica Academy of Applied Studies, Department of Business Studies Blace, Serbia (e-mail: stamenkovic.srecko@ gmail.com).\\n\\nanalyzing the source code, character by character, identifying units called lexemes. For each lexeme, the lexical analyzer produces a corresponding token as output. To understand lexical analysis, appropriate knowledge in the field of automata theory and formal languages is necessary. An automaton is an abstract functional computing device that independently executes a predefined sequence of operations . Finite automata are used to recognize regular languages. These automata are divided into deterministic (DFA -Deterministic Finite Automata) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA -Nondeterministic Finite Automata). The syntax analyzer, or socalled parser, takes a string of tokens from the lexical analyzer and checks whether that string belongs to the language described by the given grammar. There are different algorithms for performing this task. The three general types of parsers are: universal, top-down, and bottom-up. If the source program is correct in terms of syntax structure, the task of the syntax analyzer is to generate a syntax tree for the input string of symbols. The semantic analyzer uses the syntax tree and information from the symbol table to check the semantic compliance of the source program with the language definition. It also collects type information and stores it in the syntax tree or symbol table, for further use when generating intermediate code. After optimizing the intermediate code, the code is generated directly into the target machine's machine language or assembly language.\\n\\nBased on the given theoretical overview, it can be seen that the compiler is a very complex set of different techniques and algorithms and that the compiling process consists of several independent phases. Each of these phases represents a separate teaching unit, with topics that abound in abstract concepts. Students receive only a rudimentary understanding of compilers through abstract theoretical materials, while exercises are primarily devoted to algorithms, data structures, and theoretical constructs . A lecture-based approach like this does not adequately educate engineering students for the \\\"professional world\\\" . Chesnevar, González, and Maguitman discovered, based on many years of teaching experience, that most students do not feel motivated or interested in studying formal languages and automata theory . They believe that the reason for the lack of enthusiasm is not only the complexity of the topics but also the fact that the topics are more closely related to mathematics than computer science. Because of all of this, it is reasonable to assume that teaching compilers is a challenging task for lecturers as well. To properly prepare students for this task, a new approach to teach and practice the compilation process that is complementary to the existing curriculum is Nenad Jovanović is with the University of Priština in Kosovska Mitrovica, Faculty of Technical Sciences, Serbia (e-mail: nenad.jovanovic@pr.ac.rs). A detailed analysis of the reasons for this outcome at the end of the compiler course led to the assumption that the introduction of an educational software system could help students better understand the material. To improves traditional teaching, in many areas of computer science, visualization tools, simulators, animation systems and other educational software tools for illustration and visualization of abstract concepts are successfully applied. Educational systems differ depending on the field in which they are used. It is common for hardware related courses to use software simulators  to avoid the high cost of the necessary equipment for laboratory exercises. Algorithm animation systems have been proposed in many studies for learning complex algorithms . Although some research has been conducted to show that animations in learning can bring a false sense of satisfaction, negatively affecting the development of learning strategies, visualizations and simulations are extremely useful for understanding dynamic activities and can give more confidence and motivation to students .\\n\\nWe analyzed the possibility of using some of the existing tools in the Compiler course at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Pristina. These tools are presented and compared in the third section. Although there are many such systems , a relatively small number possess the necessary features and functionalities. In contrast, among the analyzed methods, there is not a single system that thoroughly covers the required number of topics of the Compiler course. For the most part, each is developed to meet specific requirements (e.g., handles a particular algorithm, a single topic, or a compilation phase). Also, in terms of interactivity and visual representation, the analyzed tools did not meet the requirements of the Compiler course. Therefore, a decision was made to develop a new software system.\\n\\nThe compiler's design influences the quality of the output code and, hence, the application's performance. Compiler algorithms and techniques enable the identification and prevention of numerous code defects and malicious code. To properly grasp computer security courses, students should know basic compiler concepts. The scientific area of program translators is intertwined with different fields such as computer architecture and organization, programming languages, formal languages and automata theory, computing theory, and software engineering. As a result, the development of a new simulation system is more justifiable because it will allow for broader applicability.\\n\\nThe basic hypothesis of this research is: It is possible to find an efficient and effective solution to assist students and lecturers in learning and teaching topics related to compilers.\\n\\nThe expected contributions of this research are:\\n\\n• A general review of the field of educational simulation systems to help in learning, with emphasis on the need for an interactive component in educational software, as well as the power of visualization in contributing to more effective knowledge transmission; • Defining a model for the development of an interactive software system for the simulation and visualization of algorithms used in various phases of program translation, based on pedagogical and usability goals; • Implementation of the educational software system based on the defined model • Suggested learning technique with the developed tool; • Improvement of the teaching process using the implemented educational tool. In 2018, we started a project called ComVis (Compiler Visualization System), which is a modular software system composed of a set of interactive educational tools to help learn and teach compiler topics. Section Related Work briefly presents basic information about the first tools developed in the previous ComVis desktop generation. With the desktop application, we noticed an availability problem because it is only related to the Windows platform and a problem with the distribution of the installation package. Features were often improved, and bugs were fixed, which required notifying users, distributing the new version, and engaging users during installation. The new system was designed as a web application to overcome these problems. In this way, ComVis has become available on different platforms, and the improvement of existing and new functions is now made automatically and without user involvement. Simulation and visualization of algorithms are now done within the same user interface. Most of the simulations in the desktop version included only a textual description of the results without visualization of the object of study or the ability to control the flow of the simulation. This paper presents a new improved version of the ComVis simulator, which is now developed as a web-based application. Web-based ComVis, in addition to better visual presentation, simulation control, debugging system, and many other improved features, also contains new modules that expand the number of topics that can be learned with this system. Functionality has improved due to explicitly defined pedagogical goals and usability goals, which together form the model by which the new system was developed.\\n\\nThis paper is systematized in five sections. In the second section, the motivation for this research is presented. The third section presents simulation systems that have been successfully applied in various fields of science. In addition to the old version of the ComVis system, in the that section, other simulation systems are offered that are suitable for learning topics from the subject of compilers. The fourth section contains details on the implementation of the new web-based simulation system ComVis. Algorithms and techniques that can be learned with this system are described, as is the coverage of topics in the compiler course. The fifth section describes using the ComVis system in the teaching process. The evaluation results, based on the controlled experiment and user feedback, are presented and discussed in detail in the sixth section. In addition, this section compares the new web-based ComVis system with the previous desktop version. Finally, in the seventh section, we provide a plan for our future work, including a summary of possible improvements and achievements that we could achieve.\\n\\n## II. MOTIVATION\\n\\n\\nMonitoring the activities of students in the compiler course at the Faculty of Technical Sciences of the University of Pristina during the semester revealed that they struggle to understand the material because they are encountering complex and abstract theoretical concepts of the compiler for the first > REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR MANUSCRIPT ID NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < time, resulting in a lack of motivation and engagement in this course. All of this culminates in poor exam performance. In Table  shows the ratio of students registered to take the Compilers exam and the number of students who passed this exam at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Pristina.\\n\\nProgramming languages are an exciting discipline for students because numerous development environments enable a quick and simple check of the correctness of the written program code. However, feedback on applied techniques and algorithms is missing when learning about compiler construction. Also, Table  shows the ratio of the average grades achieved in the courses Compilers and Internet application programming.\\n\\nIntroducing interactive software tools as teaching aids can boost students' motivation . In this way, students get the opportunity to try different options and instantly evaluate the acquired theoretical knowledge. In addition to interactivity, the software used in education should have another important feature, which can contribute to a more effective transfer of knowledge: the ability to visualize the subject of study . Specially designed educational software products open up new possibilities in developing students' necessary skills and abilities (practical, verbal, perceptive, mental...) . It can be said that visualization sparks students' imaginations and deepens their understanding. Rutten et al. in the paper  reviews a large number of experimental studies, which have been published for a decade, on the effects of computer simulations in education. Many studies reviewed in this paper compare working conditions with and without simulations, showing positive results in favor of using simulations to improve traditional learning methods. The authors in  propose a didactic strategy for learning the theory of automata and formal languages, which consists of five principles, one of which refers to the application of software tools in teaching. The strategy was tested on a group of students and the results were quite encouraging. Didactic techniques that involve using simulation systems to improve the learning of automata and formal languages are described in . All these facts motivated us to develop the system for interactive visual representation and simulation of the compiling process as part of laboratory exercises in the Compiler course at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Pristina.\\n\\nThere is no course exhaustively covers all topics related to the design and implementation of compilers, because compilers are composed of multiple subsystems with many internal components and algorithms and complex interactions between them. Moreover, compilers represent the field of computer science, in which mathematical models and theoretical concepts, such as automata theory, graph theory, formal languages, and grammar are successfully applied in practical implementations of lexical analyzers, parsers, semantic analyzers, code optimizers, etc. Most existing compiler courses in the world's universities generally divide the curriculum into topics corresponding to the stages of compilation. Therefore, our goal is to develop a modular simulation system so that each module covers the corresponding compilation phase.\\n\\n## III. RELATED WORK\\n\\n\\nSoftware tools to aid learning have become available in all phases of education in recent years. Educational software systems are available today for almost every field of science. In the field of electronic sciences, a significant variety of simulation systems are used. Zhang and Jie consider that analog electrical technology theory is highly abstract and difficult to grasp, and therefore propose the introduction of simulation software for learning. They outline the features of the new simulation software and how it helps overcome teaching issues in . The author's experience on the use of simulation software for the field of renewable energy sources is presented and discussed in . Simulation has been proven to be effective for interpreting facts that would otherwise be inaccessible, making solar and renewable energy sources more obvious. The use of computer simulations in the teaching of microbiology was discussed in , genetics in , and surgery in . Software systems have been successfully used for learning mathematical algorithms , probability theory , statistics , graph theory .\\n\\nEducational software systems are rapidly evolving, particularly in the field of computer engineering . Jovanovic et al.  provided simulation systems for studying computer networks. An educational computer system with a web-based simulator designed to help in the teaching and learning of computer architecture was presented by Djordjevic et al. . Visual simulators have also been used to aid in the learning of data security algorithms . A detailed analysis of several systems for the visualization of artificial intelligence algorithms is presented in . The conclusion is that educational software systems are used in practically all scientific domains and produce favorable outcomes in terms of upgrading traditional teaching methods.\\n\\nBy searching the literature, we found several simulation systems and algorithm visualization systems that can be used to learn some of the topics from Compiler course. We analyzed these systems in more detail in the paper . We defined two groups of criteria for their evaluation. The first group consists of criteria related to the characteristics and functionality of the system, while the second group includes criteria related to the coverage of topics. Table  shows all systems analyzed in .\\n\\nAn essential feature of the simulator, which directly affects the learning process, is the possibility of interactive monitoring of the simulation flow. Unfortunately, most of the analyzed simulators do not provide the option of interaction. The analysis found that some simulators do not even have a graphical user interface, but are based on a console. The evaluation based on the first group of criteria showed that JFLAP and LISA stand out as the best simulators in graphic display, intuitive design, interactive simulation flow and other functionalities. Based on the second group of criteria, the evaluation results showed that there is not a single simulator that covers all the topics provided by the curriculum. The reason is the complexity of the translation process, which consists of several different abstract phases, which we discussed in the previous chapters. These are primarily simulators specialized for narrower areas of compilers. The most represented are simulation systems that simulate automata and simulators that affect the parsing process. JFLAP and LISA provide the best coverage of topics. This analysis further motivated us to start a project to develop a new simulation system for learning compilers. First, we implemented the ComVis Finite Automata module , which represents an educational environment for learning the basic principles on which the operation of finite automata is based. The system was implemented as an interactive desktop application in the Java programming language. Using this software, finite automata can be defined in a graphical editor as a state diagram or by specifying a transition function using a transition table. After defining the automaton, it is possible to run a visual simulation of the operation of the automaton for an arbitrary input sequence. An example of constructing a finite automaton in this educational environment is shown in Fig. . ComVis finite automata, in addition to visualizing the operation of finite automata, allows students to convert regular expressions into DFA or NFA and simulate Thomson's algorithm .\\n\\nQuantitative analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of this simulator based on a survey of undergraduate students at two universities, one in Serbia and one in India, showed positive results . The students found that the simulation tool helped them better understand finite automata and allowed them to design even more complicated DFAs and NFAs than they could without it, i.e., with paper and pencil. Due to these facts, we continued to develop and upgrade ComVis, so it was soon extended with new tools: Scanner, NP Parser, LL(1) Parser, SR Parser, LR(0) Parser. These tools are presented in . Scanner aims to bring students closer to lexical analysis in the compilation process. A lexical analyzer takes a stream of characters, groups them into tokens, and produces an output sequence of tokens. The simulation environment allows students to simulate the process of constructing syntax tables LL(1) and LR(1). The system also enables the calculation of FIRST and FOLLOW sets. The evaluation of the efficiency of the complete ComVis desktop software system presented in  shows that the use of this tool in the teaching process directly affects the reduction of the percentage of students who cannot pass the exam in the first term. In addition, the teachers noticed that the student's concentration and interest in the course subjects increased noticeably.\\n\\nThe students noticed the following limitations using the tool: the system was used as a desktop application only for the Windows environment and the lack of a semantic analysis module. Taking into account feedback from students and teachers who also mentioned accessibility as a limitation of the simulator, we defined the goals for the new research. Although the coverage evaluation in  showed that ComVis has already reached the currently available tools, our primary goal is to develop additional modules and expand the functionality of the existing ones to cover new topics, primarily the semantic analysis module. Also, an important goal is to use the software system as a web-based application, which will remove platform limitations. Previous analyzes show that this goal is fully justified, showing that of all the tools (Table ), only four were developed as web-based applications. These are JCT, Seshat, SELFA-Pro and Webworks applets. At the time of writing, only two Seshat and SELFA-Pro were available on the official web addresses of these systems. Both systems have a low degree of coverage of topics.\\n\\n## IV. COMVIS -WEB-BASED SIMULATION TOOL: DESIGN APPROACHES\\n\\n\\nConsidering that the ComVis desktop application was positively evaluated in the conducted evaluations , the first task in developing the web-based version  was to maintain or improve the existing features, functions and visual presentations. The second task was related to increasing the number of learning topics with the simulation system. The main goal of developing the ComVis simulation system was to improve the traditional approach to teaching and learning in the Compiler course. Even at the beginning of redesigning the existing modules of ComVis, we , and mostly everywhere, the following goals that educational software should fulfill are emphasized:\\n\\n• accessibility (easy to find, download and install),\\n\\n• intuitiveness (easy to use),\\n\\n• interactivity (interactions that cause users to think),\\n\\n• visualization control (following the visualization of the execution of the algorithm, step by step), • adaptability (allowing instructors to adapt them to several different laboratory experiments and curricula), • distance learning (all modern educational tools aiming for wide acceptance should support distance learning). Since the ComVis desktop version is developed in the Java programming language, JSP (Java Server Pages) is required for the backend technology of the web version. In this way, most of the algorithms written in Java for the desktop application were also used in the new web application. In addition, the Java Swing library was used for the desktop application to represent graphic elements. The web application's graphical user interface and all visualization elements are made using the following frontend technologies: HTML, JavaScript, CSS. In addition to these standard technologies, Graphviz was also usedopen-source software for graph visualization . Graphviz made it possible to present the structured text results of the algorithm execution more clearly in the form of diagrams and graphs.\\n\\nThe implementation details of all modules are described below. New modules and functions are described in more detail, while those that already existed in the desktop version are commented in terms of differences and advantages. Also, when describing the modules and functions of ComVis, a comparison is made with the JFLAP and Seshat tools. JFLAP was chosen as a desktop representative of the simulator that has achieved wide application in several world universities  and which in terms of functionality, showed the best results in the evaluation . Seshat is one of the best representatives of web-based simulators for learning compilers , which is available when writing this paper.\\n\\n## A. Implementation of the module for learning lexical analysis\\n\\n\\nThe module for learning lexical analysis consists of three independent submodules: Scanner, Finite Automata and Regular Expression. Each of them has its own user environment within a separate website. In the desktop version for lexical analysis, there were two environments Scanner and Finite Automata.\\n\\n## 1) Finite Automata\\n\\n\\nThe Finite Automata submodule is intended for learning the theory of automata and regular grammars. It has retained a similar graphical interface, but the number of functions, visual capabilities and learnable topics is now significantly greater.\\n\\nThe layout of the user interface of this submodule with an example of a constructed finite state machine can be seen in Fig. . As with the desktop application and in the web environment, the student can quickly and easily design, modify and graphically simulate finite automata. It is also possible to save designed automata, as well as open and modify previously saved ones.\\n\\nThe canvas for drawing automata is implemented using the HTML Canvas element. Compared to the previous version, new options are the Undo, Redo options and the option to display the transitions table. The advantage of a web system is the textual description of the automaton, which is automatically synchronized with changes on the screen. In addition to the possibility of constructing an automaton by drawing a diagram on the canvas, ComVis and JFLAP also provide the opportunity of creating using a transition table. Seshat does not offer such an option.\\n\\n## a)\\n\\n\\nFA operation simulation for input string After constructing the automaton, ComVis provides the student with the opportunity to enter the desired string and monitor the operation of the automaton. With desktop version of ComVis, the automaton simulation was shown step by step, but without the possibility of the user influencing the simulation. In the new web version, the user fully controls the simulation. For example, the layout of the simulation mode is shown in Fig. .\\n\\nSeshat does not provide the possibility to simulate the operation of the finite automaton for the corresponding input string. On the other hand, JFLAP provides construction and simulation of automata similarly to ComVis.\\n\\n## b)\\n\\n\\nSimulation of Hopcroft's DFA minimization algorithms A minimal equivalent automaton accepts the same sequences as the starting automaton. For a given automaton there are many different equivalent automatons. Among such automata, it is interesting to find the one with the smallest number of states. • Compatibility condition -states Qx and Qy must be either acceptance states or rejection states. • Propagation condition -transitions from these states, for each input symbol, must be in mutually equivalent states. The procedure for constructing a minimal AL automaton of the language L, starting from an automaton A that recognizes L, is called the minimization of the automaton A. Let an automaton A = (Σ, Q, q0, δ, F) be given with an initial state q0 and a set of final states F. For state q ∈ Q is a reachable state if there exists a string u ∈ Σ\\\\* such that δ(a0, u) = a. Otherwise, a is an unattainable (redundant) state. Accordingly, the automaton minimization procedure is carried out in the following steps:\\n\\n• removal of redundant states,\\n\\n• finding sets of mutually equivalent states and replacing such sets of states with one representative for each of the sets. In the web-based ComVis, we have implemented a minimization method known as the partitioning technique. This technique is well known in automata theory and numerous areas of computer science, such as graph theory, strings, and Boolean matrices. One of the algorithms that perform the minimization of automata using the partitioning method is Hopcroft's algorithm . To write this algorithm in the Java programming language, we used the guidelines of the author Yingjie , which are given in the form of pseudo-code shown in Fig. .\\n\\nThis algorithm is based on the fact that state equivalence is an equivalence relation, which means that according to this relation, the set of all states is divided into mutually disjunct subsets. In each subgroup, there are mutually equivalent states. To find the partition of the location of states according to this relation, we apply an iterative procedure in several steps; in each step, we refine the separation of the group of states until we obtain the final section. Initially, we divide the states into two subsets -one contains all acceptance states (final), and the other includes rejection states, i.e., all other states {Q -F, F}.\\n\\nIn the following steps, we try to break down individual sets of states further, determining which states do not satisfy the propagation condition. In each step of the algorithm, we will have a partition P and a worklist W. A more detailed explanation of the pseudo-code of Hopcroft's algorithm, can be found in . An example of the simulation of the minimization process in the ComVis simulation mode is shown in Fig. . Students can follow the simulation step by step, with the possibility to go back. At each stage, there is a corresponding explanation of the action being carried out at that moment.\\n\\nThe desktop version of the ComVis simulator did not include the option to simulate the DFA minimization procedure. JFLAP and Seshat have this option, with the fact that with Seshat the simulation is not performed in steps. Still, the table of transitions of the minimal DFA is immediately displayed, without the graphical display of the minimal automaton.\\n\\n## c) FA to Regular Expression Conversion Simulation\\n\\n\\nThe algorithm used by ComVis to simulate the FA conversion process into a regular expression is known as the state elimination method, or initially the Brzozowski and McCluskey algorithm . It eliminates the states of the automaton, one after the other, while transforming the transitions so that the language accepted by the resulting automaton remains unchanged . A new initial state Si is added to the finite automaton connected to the existing initial state, and each final state FA is connected to a new final state Sf as shown in Fig. .\\n\\nAfter that, the iterative process of eliminating FA states one after another begins, with the formation of corresponding new transitions. At the end of the algorithm, only two states remain that were added at the beginning of Si and Sf, as well as one transition between them. For each eliminated state, a regular expression is produced, as a label for the new transition. The created regular expression is the input to the condition that should be eliminated next. In the elimination condition, the regular expression is accumulated. An example of one step of the state elimination method is shown in Fig. . The left diagram shows the Q2 state to be eliminated and the transitions to be transformed. The correct graph shows the automaton after removing the given state and a new label for the change from Q1 to Q3. The languages accepted by the automaton before and after eliminating Q2 are the same.\\n\\nThe described method is implemented in the web-based ComVis. Students can follow each step of this iterative method with the ability to control the flow of the simulation. Also, in each step, an appropriate explanation of the actions taken is written, as well as an announcement of the following state that will be eliminated in the next step. An example of one simulation step within the ComVis simulation mode can be seen in Fig. . The desktop version of ComVis could not convert FAs to regular expressions. JFLAP provides a simulation of the process of converting FA to regular expression, also by state elimination method. Seshat does not support this feature.\\n\\n## 2) Scanner\\n\\n\\nWithin the Scanner submodule, the student enters the code for analysis and, by pressing the Scan button, begins to monitor the analysis process. The Scanner reads the source code, written in the Input text field, character by character while identifying lexical units -lexemes. Each lexeme is associated with a corresponding token. A token can be defined by a string of characters or a pattern.\\n\\nTemplates are constructed using regular expressions, defining rules so that each token is recognized as a valid token. For example, the pattern for defining an identifier can be as follows: [A-Za-z\\\\_][A-Za-z0-9]\\\\*.\\n\\nWith the desktop version of ComVis, the student could only see the generated token array. In the web version, this module has been improved. Each line of input code is analyzed separately. Recognized tokens are further sent to the parser for syntax analysis. The syntax analyzer, or so-called parser, takes a string of tokens from the lexical analyzer and checks whether that string belongs to the language described by the given grammar. The user receives a notification about whether the syntax of the entered code is correct, and if it is not, an error is indicated. In addition to monitoring the lexical and syntax analysis process, Scanner also enables the creation of a table of symbols. Symbol table information is required for semantic analysis and code generation. After finishing the study student also receives information about the semantic compatibility of the source program with the language definition. JFLAP and Seshat do not have this type of Scanner to track input code tokenization.\\n\\n## 3) Regular Expressions\\n\\n\\nThe third way to define a finite automaton is through a regular expression. In this submodule, it is possible to convert a regular expression into a DFA or NFA, follow the steps of Thomson's algorithms for converting a regular expression into an NFA, and construct a syntax tree for the desired regular expression. In the web version, only the graphical display of these functionalities has been improved compared to the desktop version, so details about these options are available in . An example of the display of the Thomson algorithm using the web-based ComVis is shown in Fig. . The algorithm works recursively by dividing the regular expression into its component subexpressions and applying the appropriate set of rules to the subexpressions. NFA construction is performed . In addition, JFLAP and Seshat have an option to convert a regular expression to an NFA but not a syntax tree.\\n\\n## B. Implementation of the module for learning syntax analysis\\n\\n\\nAs we emphasized in the introductory part, the task of the syntax analyzer is to receive a string of symbols (tokens) from the lexical analyzer and check whether that string belongs to the language described by the given grammar. The syntax analyzer aims to generate a syntax tree for the input string of symbols. To create the syntax tree, it is necessary to apply the appropriate rules for mapping the start symbol to the analyzed string. As context-free grammars are usually used to describe languages, one non-terminal symbol is mapped to a word in each step of the execution. Concerning how they perform syntax analysis, there are two types of syntax analyzers:\\n\\n• top-down analyzers that perform top-down analysis,\\n\\n• bottom-up analyzers that perform analysis from the bottom up. Using the ComVis simulator, students can familiarize themselves with the algorithms applied in both top-down and bottom-up analyzers. In addition, the Synatax analysis module includes submodules that simulate the algorithm of nonrecursive predictive parser, LL (k), and LR (k) parser.\\n\\n## 1) Non-recursive predictive parser\\n\\n\\nWe presented the non-recursive predictive parser algorithm and implementation details in . In this submodule, students can define the grammar based on which they will follow the parsing process. The user enters productions of context-free grammar in a separate section for defining language rules. As with the desktop version, the web-based ComVis generates and displays a parsing table and the parsing process for a userspecified input string. The difference is that the web system has an improved visual representation. Since the algorithm of nonrecursive predictive parsing takes place in iterations for each input character, we took advantage of this in the web simulator and allowed users to follow each iteration. Students can now follow a simulation of the parsing process in self-controlled steps. JFLAP and Seshat do not provide the ability to learn nonrecursive predictive parsing.\\n\\n## 2) LL(1) parser\\n\\n\\nAn efficient algorithm for top-down analysis is LL(1) (lookleft 1), where the digit 1 indicates that the prediction is made based on a single letter in the input string. Generally speaking, LL(k) analyzers can also be defined where prediction is made based on words of length k, but LL( ) is much more usable. More about the implementation of this algorithm in the ComVis simulator can be found in . As with the previous submodule, the visual representation of the parsing process has been improved by simulating the algorithm in steps that correspond to the analysis of each symbol of the input string. Fig.  shows an example of one simulation step of LL(1) parsing. JFLAP also allows the simulation of LL(1) parsing, while Seshat does not cover this topic.\\n\\n## 3) LR(0) Parser\\n\\n\\nLR analyzers are most often found in commercial compiler solutions. These are efficient bottom-up analyzers. In the general case, they can be LR(k). LR analyzers can recognize all program constructions that context-free grammar can describe. The realization of the LR(0) analyzer is based on the definition of the so-called LR(0) items. It applies the closure function to close the LR(0) items and the goto function to initialize a new set of LR(0) items. Then, LR(0) items are generated based on grammar rules, and each rule yields several LR(0) items. Finally, an LR automaton is generated based on the collected collection of these items. The result is an LR syntax table. We presented more details about the implementation of this algorithm in the ComVis simulator in . As with the previous two submodules, we have enabled users to follow the steps of the LR(0) parsing process. Also, a innovation compared to the desktop version is the monitoring of the current state of the LR automaton in a given step of the simulation (Fig. ). JFLAP and Seshat do not provide this possibility.\\n\\n## C. Implementation of the module for learning semantic analysis\\n\\n\\nThe semantic analysis learning module is a new feature implemented in the web-based ComVis. The JFLAP and Seshat tools do not provide the ability to learn semantic analysis. This is the most significant advantage of ComVis, because it wraps up the entire process that is done by the front end of the compiler.\\n\\nDescribing language instructions via context-free grammar is usually not sufficient for language translation. A formal description of the language cannot represent many problems. Therefore, additional information is added to the language rules by adding specific attributes to the grammar symbols. The attribute's value is determined by the semantic routine associated with the rule used in the corresponding node of the syntax tree. Attributes can be generated and inherited. The generated attribute values are calculated as functions of the corresponding node's descendant attributes. The importance of the inherited attributes is calculated as functions of the attributes of the parent nodes and the attributes of the other nodes at the same level. A syntax tree that contains attribute values associated with nodes is called an Annotated Syntax Tree. Fig.  shows a set of grammar rules that describe a simple language for specifying basic mathematical operations. Based on this language definition, the student can enter The Semantic analysis module provides several different analyses. So, before simulating the semantic analysis, the student can start the lexical analysis to ensure that the given expressions are lexically correct. After that, it can begin the parsing process and check the syntax of the entered code. It also has a symbol table and syntax tree views available. The following options are available for a deeper understanding of the semantic analysis process: the display of the Annotated Syntax Tree, evaluation of given expressions, and simulation of semantic analysis. Evaluation for expressions: a:=5+7; b:=3+a\\\\*(1+3); is shown in Fig. . In this case, the student receives an Annotated Syntax Tree graphic and a textual description of the evaluation results. Expression values are calculated via the val attribute. The lexval attribute retrieves from the symbol table the value of the digit represented by the NUMBER token.\\n\\nThe student can best understand the semantic analysis by following the animation of the formation of the semantic tree and evaluating the attributes on the tree's nodes. This animation is possible in simulation mode, where the student follows the creation of the semantic tree at every step, and receives information about the actions taken following the grammar and information about the currently recognized token (Fig. ).\\n\\n## V. THE USAGE OF THE COMVIS SIMULATION SYSTEM\\n\\n\\nThe ComVis simulation system covers most of the laboratory exercises of the Comiler course. Table  shows the thematic units covered in laboratory exercises using this educational environment. The Association for Computing Machinery and IEEE Computer Society have established curriculum guidelines for undergraduate computer engineering programs  that recommend courses and appropriate topics. Based on this document, it can be concluded that the developed ComVis system, in addition to the Principle of Compiler System course, can be used as an auxiliary tool for learning certain topics in the following courses: Formal Language and Automata, Computing Algorithms, Software Design, and Embedded Systems. This fulfills the hypothesis that the system has a general application.\\n\\nThe traditional method of theory-examples-exercises should be used to teach the compiler's course. Theoretical notions for each topic are initially introduced in theory classes. Laboratory exercises include a more extensive explanation of the topics covered in lectures with the use of simulators for visual presentation of the presented concepts. Each exercise is made up of three parts: an example demonstration, a laboratory task, and knowledge evaluation. Students should read the relevant material from lectures and textbooks and the corresponding laboratory material to prepare for the exercise. At the beginning of the laboratory exercise, the lecturer demonstrates examples within the educational tool. The lecturer should exploit the system's capabilities to engage students; otherwise, the exercises would just be a different approach to the theoretical presentation. The interactive approach to the demonstration, following the principles of active learning, also entails engaging the learner so that they are not just passive observers. The simplest technique to keep students engaged during the demonstration is to pose \\\"what if\\\" questions regularly and have them anticipate the outcomes. For example, during a demonstration of the operation of a finite automaton in ComVis, a new transition or state may be added, and students can be asked to explain the consequences of the changes made. Students can immediately see if their answers are correct using the simulation mode. Following the completion of the demonstration, students are given appropriate laboratory tasks to complete independently within the software system. Due to the increased functionalities, laboratory exercises have been corrected about those proposed for working with the desktop version of ComVis. An illustrative example of a practice is presented in . Using this tool, we noticed that students' motivation and attention increased during the exercises, manifested by their more active participation. During the introductory instructions about the thematic unit and how to apply the ComVis system for a given topic, we noticed that students asked various questions about the tool's capabilities. Also, during the exercises, students desired to propose and test some examples themselves. More advanced students immediately moved on to work with more complex examples, while other students had to start with simpler ones because they had a lower level of prior knowledge. The ComVis simulation system, unlike all analyzed tools, also contains a part for assessing students' knowledge. By implementing this module, we have fulfilled all the set pedagogical goals. The Tests module is accessed by the student logging in with their access data. Professors also have the opportunity to log in to the system, which allows them to edit knowledge tests and monitor student activities. After completing the laboratory exercise, students log in to the system and in the Tests section at the top of the page, they have the option to start the test. Each test contains quiz questions related to the covered thematic unit. Tests are time limited. In his control panel, the professor defines the number of questions, their content, number of points, and duration. At the end of the completed test, the student receives information about the number of correct answers and the right answers to the questions he got wrong. In addition, professors receive a record of the success of all students.\\n\\n## VI. EVALUATION OF THE WEB-BASED SIMULATION SYSTEM COMVIS\\n\\n\\nEvaluation of educational software implies collecting, analyzing and interpreting information about any aspect of an education and training program as part of assessing its usability and effectiveness . Therefore, two characteristics are essential for educational software systems: the usability of the system and the efficiency, that is, the success of using the system in teaching. In this paper, we perform a quantitative evaluation of the system's efficiency through a controlled experiment and a qualitative evaluation of usability, which consists of student surveys and heuristic tests by experts.\\n\\n## A. Comparative analysis of the new web-based ComVis and the old desktop version\\n\\n\\nBefore evaluating the usability and efficiency of the webbased ComVis system, it is necessary to compare it with other software tools suitable for learning compilers. Given that the study  compared the desktop version of ComVis to other already available tools in terms of functionality and topic coverage, only a comparison of the new web-based ComVis and the old desktop version is appropriate here. The criteria from  were used to analyze the qualities, which were extended with criteria related to the aims specified in Section 4. Table  depicts this evaluation.\\n\\nTable  shows a list of all topics supported by both systems, which was used to assess topic coverage.\\n\\nRegarding the criteria related to the features and functionality of the system, it can be stated that the web-based ComVis meets all the set requirements and is functionally the most advanced educational system for learning compilers. The distinction is clear when evaluating based on coverage criteria. The new system supports 25% more topics than the previous version.\\n\\n## B. Quantitative evaluation of efficiency\\n\\n\\nA controlled experiment examined the effectiveness or success of the educational software tool. This method involves monitoring and comparing the learning outcomes of two groups of students. One group consisted of students who used the webbased ComVis system as an additional teaching tool in learning the topics of compilers. The second group was a control group, so the students' learning in this group was based on traditional methods without an auxiliary software tool. Similar methods of evaluation of educational tools were used in . The experiment was conducted in the academic year 2021-2022. We formed two groups of 21 students, considering the equal To prove that there is no significant difference between these groups, we used a pre-test that contained questions about fundamental concepts in the field of compilers. Although the questions were chosen to be related to compilers, students could gain knowledge about them in other courses. For example, information about the basic functions of compilers and interpreters can be found in the programming languages course, assembly and machine language information in the computer architecture and organization course, graph and tree representations in the algorithms and data structures course, etc. The pre-test included 25 questions, each question carried 4 points, so the maximum number of points is 100. The results achieved at the end of this test are shown in Table .\\n\\nFor reliable analysis of the obtained results, we used the Student's t-Test. To check the variances, we used the F-Test. Since the F-Test showed that the variances of the two sets of results are equivalent, we used the t-Test (Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances) with the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the two groups of students. The results of these analyzes are shown in Table . Since the pvalue is 0.457>0.05, it can be concluded that the null hypothesis was confirmed: that the two groups of students did not differ significantly before the experiment.\\n\\nBoth groups attended lectures on formal languages and grammar, the theory of automata, and lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis. The lecturers and assistants in the laboratory exercises were the same for both groups of students. The compiler course includes 30 hours of theoretical lectures and 30 hours of laboratory exercises. The experimental group interacted with the ComVis tool during 20 hours of laboratory exercises. Other practice classes were devoted to topics unsupported by the simulation system. The recommended method in Section 5 describes how to use the tool. After the lectures from the mentioned thematic units, both groups received a colloquium with the same tasks. The colloquium in the Compiler course carries a total of 25 points and contains 25 questions, so each question is worth one point. In this case, the colloquium represented a post-test, the purpose of which is to assess the abilities and success of students after implementing different learning methods. The results of the colloquium are shown in Table .\\n\\nBy comparing the mean values of the results achieved at the colloquium, the progress of the experimental group can be observed. Descriptive statistics (F-Test and t-Test) suitable for analyzing the obtained results are shown in Table . In this case, the result of the t-test indicated the rejection of the null hypothesis, which showed a significant difference between the two groups (p-value= 0.004 < 0.05). Therefore, it implies that the students in the experimental group gained a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts and algorithms in the Compiler field.\\n\\nThe groups' results were discussed previously, and in Fig. , a graphic representation of students' individual results from both groups is given. The graph clearly shows the advantage of the experimental group compared to the control group. Five students won the maximum points in the experimental group, while only two was in the control group. Four students in the experimental group scored below 20 points, while fourteen were in the control group.\\n\\nThese are only preliminary results on the effectiveness of the ComVis web-based simulation system, obtained on a small group of students, but they certainly encourage continued research. In the coming period, we will monitor the learning results of new generations of students, who will use this tool as part of laboratory exercises.\\n\\n## C. Usability assessment based on user experience\\n\\n\\nIn addition to evaluating the web-based ComVis simulator based on measurable results, we also conducted a qualitative evaluation using a survey. After the colloquium, we asked the students who used ComVis in the learning process to fill out a questionnaire about the usability of the simulator. The survey was anonymous and consisted of questions with free answers based on a Likert scale (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, Strongly agree). This assessment method and the questions are similar to the paper . The questions as well as the summarized results of the survey are shown in Table .\\n\\nTo make the results of the survey more transparent for analysis, we used ratings from 1 to 5 that correspond to answers from Strongly disagree to Strongly agree. The average scores for each question are shown in Table .\\n\\nQuestion number 2 and 5 have the best marks, which indicates that ComVis also fulfilled the pedagogical goal of increasing students' attention and motivation. The question regarding the system's intuitiveness received a good rating, but it is undoubtedly the least compared to the others. Students with prior knowledge of the respective topics rated the tool's intuitiveness highly. Other students needed a little help when using it for the first time. In talking with the students, we found that the proposed initial example in each of the tools of the ComVis system would be helpful for them. Therefore, after this survey, we added an option to enter examples in each submodule. Students can open the suggested examples or start their right away. The scores on questions 1 and 4 show that the ComVis system helped students understand the course material, and that the applied simulation method was easy to follow. At the end of the survey, the students had the opportunity to leave a comment, to present a perceived problem or suggestion for improving the simulator. For example, some students felt that the simulator should have a multilingual interface. A few students thought the simulator lacked a detailed user manual, while some felt that a more detailed description of algorithms and theoretical concepts was needed.\\n\\n## D. Heuristic evaluation\\n\\n\\nIn the heuristic method of evaluating the usability and functionality of an educational tool, several evaluators perform an independent inspection of the software based on a predefined list of criteria . By searching the literature, we found many papers proposing criteria for heuristic evaluation of educational software . For the evaluation of the web-based ComVis system, we used the method proposed in . The process is based on a general pattern for testing university educational software. The questionnaire consists of 24 questions classified into three categories:\\n\\n1) Teaching contents and methodology, 2) Software design characteristics, 3) Users' reaction.\\n\\nFor each category, the average score and standard deviation are calculated. Each question is graded from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest. A complete list of heuristics is presented in .\\n\\nThe heuristic evaluation of the web-based ComVis system involved the evaluator's assessment based on the proposed list of heuristics. The evaluation was performed by five expert evaluators from two different higher education institutions. Based on the analysis in the paper , it was concluded that 3-5 evaluators are enough to identify useful results in usability evaluation. Furthermore, each evaluator was allowed to make two or more passes through each simulation system tool, to examine the flow of the simulations from screen to screen, as well as the specific characteristics of each tool. The results of the applied heuristic method, based on a sample of five evaluators, are shown in Table .\\n\\nBased on the summary results from Table , we can conclude that the ComVis system received very good ratings ranging from 3 to 5. Based on the average ratings and standard deviation, we can conclude that the category related to the features and functionalities of the software system best rated. In addition to these general conclusions, it is also valuable to check the worst and best scores for each question, as it reveals strengths and, more importantly, weaknesses in the software being tested. A graphical representation of the results based on the average marks for each question can be seen in Fig. .\\n\\nQuestion Q1, which refers to the justification of using computer software as an additional teaching tool in compilers, was rated the best from the Teaching contents and methodology category. Questions Q12 and Q14, which refer to the quality of the presentation of the software system and the efficiency of the use of resources (graphics, tables, texts...) are the best rated in the second category, but also in general. In the third category, the evaluators were satisfied with the interaction between the user and the software (Q22). In general, the worst results are given by questions Q9 and Q17, which refer to the guidelines for use and instructions for the use of the software, as well as question Q11, which refers to the required prior knowledge. Similar conclusions emerged from the previous evaluation.\\n\\n## VII. CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented the web-based software system ComVis for the simulation and visualization of algorithms and theoretical concepts in the field of compilers. Many theoretical, abstract concepts from different phases of compilation can be illustrated using simulation systems. In the literature, a large number of such systems were developed at various universities for application in the teaching process. Through analysis, we discovered that ComVis is a complete web-based tool for coverage of the topics studied in the Compiler course. It can support laboratory exercises covering topics from languages and grammars, finite automata, and lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis. The paper presents a functional description of the system and several key design and implementation details.\\n\\nThe goal of developing such a system is to simplify the process of learning the abstract theory of compilers for students, while increasing motivation and engagement in laboratory exercises. The contribution and importance of the developed web-based ComVis system are reflected in improving the teaching process and its application as an additional teaching tool within the laboratory exercises in the Compiler course. The results of the conducted evaluations confirm precisely that. Quantitative assessment of the system's efficiency through a controlled experiment showed that the use of ComVis in the learning process led to a deeper understanding of the compiler's functioning by the experimental group's students. Qualitative evaluations have shown us shortcomings that we need to eliminate in the coming period. Primarily, work should be done on forming a detailed user manual, as well as additional guidelines that help in the course of using the tool. The positive results of the research so far have inspired us to continue developing this system both in terms of functionality and coverage of new topics. The system lacks modules to learn the topics related to the generation of intermediate code and target code, to complete the compilation process.\", \"ctr\": 0.1, \"custom_score\": 1.0, \"id\": {\"dois\": [\"10.1109/tlt.2023.3297626\"], \"nexus_id\": \"6ziicmnecsqps9rkgtr4sz87w\"}, \"issued_at\": 1704067200, \"languages\": [\"en\"], \"links\": [{\"cid\": \"bafyb4iggjy6tmup2vtls5riznvct5dxggkqf4yvplerhy7uafyboyqjjqm\", \"extension\": \"pdf\", \"filesize\": 1534401, \"md5\": \"7a7641468bd64fb0cdff2a76a02a4ad0\"}], \"metadata\": {\"container_title\": \"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies\", \"content\": {\"parsed_at\": 1701101259, \"source_extension\": \"pdf\", \"version\": \"textparser-0.1.21\"}, \"first_page\": 143, \"issns\": [\"1939-1382\", \"2372-0050\"], \"last_page\": 156, \"publisher\": \"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\", \"volume\": \"17\"}, \"page_rank\": 0.15, \"referenced_by_count\": 0, \"references\": [{\"doi\": \"10.1145/949257.949260\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/t4e.2016.052\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/1026487.1008002\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.21998\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/vl.1994.363641\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.22231\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.5937/bizinfo1902001s\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/j.compedu.2006.01.008\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/fie.1996.568522\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.13189/ujm.2016.041104\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.017\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/782941.782975\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.12783/dtssehs/icessh2018/23793\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.18086/eurosun.2016.10.03\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1080/09500690110049150\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1080/09500690110095285\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.13189/ujer.2015.031101\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/1124772.1124889\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/educon.2014.7096837\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.21998\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, 2/cae.22135\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/1121341.1121460\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/191033.191121\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/1384271.1384360\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1007/s10639-018-9739-x\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/384266.299704\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/563517.563488\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/eurcon.2007.4400374\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/te.2008.917197\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/te.2002.808277\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.20492\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.212\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/j.procs.2012.04.194\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.22353\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/363347.363387\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/cae.22456\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/0360-1315(93)90034-g\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/960875.960540\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/259963.260531\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/1097-024x(200009)30:11<1203::aid-spe338>3.0.co;2-n\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1145/1539024.1509011\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/b978-0-12-417750-5.50022-1\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/pgec.1963.263416\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1080/03057920412331272153\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1016/j.intcom.2007.08.003\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1109/tlt.2014.2315992\", \"type\": \"reference\"}, {\"doi\": \"10.1002/(sici)1099-0542(1997)5:3<181::aid-cae5>3.0.co;2-9\", \"type\": \"reference\"}], \"tags\": [\"Computer Science Applications\", \"General Engineering\", \"Education\"], \"title\": \"A Web-Based Educational System for Teaching Compilers\", \"type\": \"journal-article\", \"updated_at\": 1715869071}"
